E brief hospital course by systems 
E 1 cardiovasculara ischemia when the patient was admitted  she was ruled outfor an mi
E she did have a slight increase of her troponins which were attributed to mild demand ischemia
E in addition  shehad some slight anemia  which could also be contributed to thedemand as well in addition to the clear volume overload
E she didfine from the standpoint  had no st changes on any of her ekgs
E the patient laid her head workup for future avr and mvr with thesurgical service  with dr bio 
E her workup was extensive andincluded a cardiac catheterization  which showed no significantcoronary artery disease
E the hemodynamics were notable for thefollowing ra of 12  pa of 922344  pulmonary capillary wedgepressure of 22 with v waves to 42
E the mitral valve was grosslynormal with appropriate leaflet motion
E the av was also grossly
E the overall conclusion was elevated rightsided heart pressures
E she had no evidence of major atherosclerotic disease of thecoronary arteries
E b
E pump please see cath report as above
E the patient wasadmitted and diuresed with iv lasix  so she came down to aeuvolemic state
E her diuresis was continued with 80 mg iv lasixon a bid
E basis
E she was diuresed until there was a subsequentbump in her creatinine to 18  19
E after that point  diuresiswas slowly modified
E she was then placed back on a regimen of120 mg of po lasix qod
E that is the dosing of lasix on whichshe is discharged
E c
E rhythm the patient has a history of paroxysmal atrialfibrillation that has been rate controlled with a betablocker
E on admission  her digoxin was stopped
E she was evaluated by theep service
E they recommended epicardial lead placement atsurgery due to her tachybrady syndrome
E the patient wasdischarged on diltiazem 30 mg qid
E she will have hermedications modified status post her valvular repair in the verynear future
E d
E presurgical workup in addition to echo  right and leftheart cath  the patient had a tee performed
E tee showed normalleft atrial appendage without evidence of localized thrombus
E st judes valve was well seated in the aortic position
E therewas no significant aortic regurg that was noted
E a st judesvalve was well seated in the mitral position as well
E there wastrace mild regurgitation noted
E there was slight asynchronousmotion of the prosthetic valve apparatus that was noted
E thetricuspid valve was normal in appearance
E there was mildregurgitation present
E visualized portion of the thoracic aortarevealed minimal atheromatous plaque
E 2 pulmonary the patient remained stable from her pulmonarystandpoint
E she continued to sat well on room air
E she did notrequired any nebulizers during her stay
E 3 gi the patient was initially admitted with some abdominalpain and also nausea and vomiting
E she had a kub performed for aquestion of potential bowel obstruction
E a single frontal viewof the abdomen was obtained and is reported in the finalradiology report
E there was gas seen within the loops of smallbowel as well as the colon
E there is no bowel dilatation seen
E the overall impression was no evidence of any highgrade bowelobstruction
E it is likely that some of her pain was secondary tohepatic congestion
E the nausea and vomiting eventually resolvedand perhaps this is some type of viral illness orgastroenteritis
E she did have some episode of diarrhea prior toadmission along with some abdominal cramping
E the patient wascontinued on her ppi for gerd prophylaxis
E at one point  sherequired increasing her dosage of nexium secondary to gerdlikesymptoms
E it seemed that increasing the amount of nexium shereceived  precipitated some diarrhea
E she was returned to anormal dosing of nexium 40 mg po qd
E while inhouse
E she wasdischarged on omeprazole 20 mg po bid
E  which she willcontinue to take as an outpatient
E in addition  she was givenprescription for colace and also senokot today
E she shouldcontinue using
E 4 heme her hematocrit remained relatively stable during herstay with averaging of 26 to 27 as far as her hematocrit
E wewere not concerned with keeping her hematocrit 30 or above at alltimes given her clean coronary arteries seen from the left andalso right heart catheterization
E she did have a slight dip inher hematocrit at one point requiring two units of packed redblood cells
E her hematocrit bumped appropriately to 30 or 31
E she required no subsequent transfusions thereafter
E with regardto anticoagulation  she was placed on the heparin drip at 950units per hour to maintain a ptt between 60 and 80 secondary toher mechanical valves that are in place
E on discharge  thepatient was transitioned to lovenox 60 mg bid with a renaldosing
E she will continue to take this lovenox as an outpatientand stop it one to two days prior to her surgery as instructed
E she has home vna in place
E 5 renal her bun and creatinine was relatively stable onadmission
E it did elevate to as high as 33  34 on heradmission secondary to her ongoing diuresis
E when diuresis washeld for several days given her markedly increased urine outputand as she became more hydrated and euvolemic  her creatininereturned to its baseline of 12  13
E she has no active issuesnow
E 6 endocrine we appreciated the diabetes service for followingher very closely while inhouse
E several modifications were madeto her regimen while here to get good control of her bloodglucose
E she was maintained on a stable regimen of nph 60 unitsin the morning  nph 30 units in the evening
E she also was placedon a sliding scale
E she also received novolog of 15 units in themorning with breakfast and also 15 at dinner
E she was notreceiving any of the novolog while at lunch
E she will continueto take this regimen in home
E all of her prescriptions wereprovided by carl mcclenahan  who is following with the diabetesservice
E they will become again involved with her care as sheplans for surgery in the very near future
E 7 infectious disease the patient was stable from an idstandpoint during her entire admission
E on july  2005  thepatient was noted to have an increase in her white blood cellcount upwards towards the 20  000
E this was one day prior to aplanned surgery on may  2005 with dr villata to repair heraortic valve and also her mitral valve
E the surgery was delayedas a result of this  so an infectious workup could ensue
E shehad a urine sent that showed  the suggestion of a urinary tractinfection
E levaquin was given for treatment of her uti
E surveillance cultures were drawn daily
E given the fact that shehad a right groin hematoma that performed after the heartcatheterization we questioned whether or not this could be sometype of infectious source
E she had the hematoma aspirated  itwas negative for any organisms
E she had no other identifiedplaces as far as source of infection
E it was believed that shecould potential have endocarditis as she has had in the past
E one of her cultures actually grew out a species of abiotrophia
E there is only one culture positive  that was taken on february 
E she has had no subsequent cultures growing out at the time ofthis dictation
E we appreciate the infectious disease teamfollowing
E their recommendations were to hold antibiotics unlesssubsequent cultures began to grow out
E their recommendationswere to continue to follow all cultures and to perform a tee
E arepeat tee was performed and showed no evidence of any lesions orchange in bowel function
E there were clearly no vegetation seenon either any transthoracic echos or tees
E id maderecommendations as far as perioperative antibiotics  which wouldinclude two weeks of ceftriaxone 1 g iv bid
E under theassumption that this would be completing a course of her therapyafter sbe
E they would also recommend sending all valve tissuefor gram stain and culture as well as pathology
E if the gramstain and culture were positive  they would suggest extending thecourse of the abovementioned antibiotic therapy
E 8 neurologic the patient was given darvon and also codeine asneeded for her pain
E she complained of right groin painsecondary to the hematoma
E her pain is much improved that she isable to ambulate easily around the tl brown vo on discharge
E thehematoma is resolving and her pain is resolving as well
E 9 fluids  electrolytes  and nutrition the patient istolerating po well
E her electrolytes were repleted as neededdaily
E 10
E psychologic the patient was seen by social work
E it isclear that she has many anxieties about the surgery and also ingoing home and returning to her social environment
E shenecessitated volume prior to many procedures given her severeanxiety
E 11
E disposition the patient is stable from a medicalstandpoint with all cultures clear and no evidence of activeinfection
E her white blood cell count is now normal
E she is nowawaiting surgical repair of her valve and will have a surgeryscheduled with dr berreth office in the next one to two weeks
