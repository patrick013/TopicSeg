A history of present illness 
A this is a 90+yearold man withmultiple medical problems  who was recently admitted for a deltams and found to have multiple posterior circulation infarcts likely embolic in nature
A he was discharged yesterday and nowpresents with fevers  chills  shaking  and increasing abdominaldistention
A on admission also  noted to have increased sputumproduction and therefore question aspiration event was consideredwhile at rehab
A at his recent hospital stay  he was evaluatedfor pfo  which was found to be negative  had no paroxysmal atrialfibrillation  had hypertensive episodes to systolic bloodpressure of 240  which responded well to hydralazine
A had atroponin leak to peak of 194  which trended down and wasconsidered to be demand related
A at baseline  the patient liveswith his wife at home  walks with a walker  and requiresassistance with adls
A on arrival on the floor  the patient had atemperature of 1013  axillary  heart rate 80s to 90s  bloodpressure 180s80s  and o2 saturation of 97 on three liters
A hisabdomen was found to be quite distended  however not rigid andhad no peritoneal signs
A past medical history

A 3 depression
A 4 psoriasis
A 5 leiomyoma
A 6 hypertension
A 7 svt8 history of gi bleed
A 9 chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 13to 16
A 10
A embolic stroke in march of 2006
E hospital course 
E 1
E the patient was found to have a pansensitive e coli uti and aquestionable left lower lobe pneumonia  which would have likelybeen due to aspiration given the patients recent stroke anddocumented aspiration by speech and swallow on previousadmission
E the patients white count  which was initially 198on the day of admission trended down over the first three days ofhis admission as he was treated with levaquin
E the levaquin which will cover both the urinary tract infection and thepossibility of aspiration pneumonia will be continued for a totalof a 14day course to end on 92706
E the patients bloodcultures showed no growth
E 2 gu  the patient was found to have 15 ml of urine in hisbladder when he was admitted indicating significant urinaryretention
E a foley was placed and the patient drained the urine
E the patient was started on flomax to improve his recovery fromthe urethral obstruction
E most likely  the patient hasunderlying urinary retention that was exacerbated by his recentfoley placement during his previous admission
E then when he wentto rehab without the foley  note he did void several times priorto discharge from the hospital 
E the patient developed urinaryobstruction likely contributing to his urinary tract infectionand requiring readmission
E the foley was kept in place untilhospital day four
E when the foley was taken out  the patient didnot void at all
E a bladder scan ten hours after the foley wastaken out revealed 432 ml of urine in his bladder
E a foley wasreplaced in his bladder and urology was consulted
E urologyrecommended bladder rest for seven days meaning that the foleyshould be left in place for seven days and then he is to followup with dr booker randgaard with the foley still in place for avoiding trial within a week after discharge
E 3 renal  the patients creatinine at admission was 22  whichis significantly above his baseline
E this was attributed toacute renal failure secondary to the urinary obstruction
E whenthe foley was placed  his creatinine steadily declined  and onthe day prior to discharge was 12  which is within his normalrange
E 4 cardiovascular  the patient continued to be hypertensive withsbps greater than 200  particularly at night
E therefore  duringhis hospital course  his blood pressure regimen was titrated upsuch that at the time of discharge  his blood pressure regimen islopressor 50 qid and norvasc 10 daily
E blood pressures during24 hours prior to discharge ranged from 110 to 14070s and hisheart rate ranged 64 to 825 endocrine  the patient was treated with insulin and his poregimen while inhouse and this can be continued at rehab
E hewill be discharged on lantus 12  novolog sliding scale  andtolbutamide 500 daily
E 6 gi  the patient had a steadily rising alk phos through thecourse of his hospital stay
E at admission  it was 206 and itrose to 508
E a ggt was drawn and found to also be elevated at119  therefore a right upper quadrant ultrasound was completed which showed a contracted gallbladder with gallstones but noacute cholecystitis
E the patient was found to be constipated onthe day prior to discharge and was given a dulcolax suppository which had worked in the past
E 7 prophylaxis  the patient received lovenox subcu daily
