A history of present illness 
A the patient was admitted for an elective right heartcatheterization and reassessment of refractory chf and atrial fibrillation heis a 62yearold man witha history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an ef of 30 who was diagnosedabout ten years ago and has been stable with medical managementuntil this past year when he started developing worsening dyspneaon exertion  orthopnea  palpitations  and pnd
A his functionalstatus has declined significantly since then
A in 726  he wasadmitted for decompensated heart failure and diuresed back to dryweight
A an icd was placed at that time
A following discharge  hedeveloped afib with rapid ventricular response and underwent dccardioversion with dr gerry canseco however  relapsed shortly thereafter
A he was started on amiodarone  but developed aquestion of pulmonary toxicity with significant dry coughing
A hewas continued to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricularresponse despite maximal carvedilol and digoxin
A he is now beingelectively admitted for right heart catheterization  diuresis and possible repeat cardioversion versus amiodarone challenge and completion of his transplant evaluation
A past medical history 
A nonischemic cardiomyopathy  ef of 30  atrial fibrillation statuspost icd placement  echo in 128 with an ef of 3035 with adilated lv and anterior wall and septal hypokinesis  mild mitralregurgitation  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes

A social history 
A lives on ence he does not drink  smoke  or use any otherdrugs
D physical exam on admission 
D he was afebrile with a heart rate of 106 in atrial fibrillation
D his blood pressure is 10278 and satting 98 on room air
D he wasin no distress
D his jvp was approximately 12 cm
D he had a rightventricular heave
D his rate was irregularly irregular with ans3  no murmurs
D chest is clear to auscultation
D he had apalpable pulsatile liver tip  but otherwise  his abdomen wasbenign
D he had no lower extremity edema
E hospital course by system 
E he is a 62yearold man with nonischemic cardiomyopathy  ef 30 awaiting transplant who is now admitted for right heartcatheterization and diuresis for volume overload and possibleamiodarone challenge versus cardioversion  rate and rhythmcontrol atrial fibrillation
E cardiovascular the patient had no evidence of ischemia
E he wasmildly volume overloaded and was gently diuresed with po lasixand eventually bid
E po torsemide at 60 mg bid
E he wasdiuresed onto his dry weight of 70 kilograms
E he underwentexercise stress testing and was able to go for 7 minutes withoutany ischemic changes
E his rhythm rate was in atrial fibrillationthroughout
E he has peak oxygen uptake with above is anaerobicthreshold and his peak respiratory exchange ratio was 144
E heunderwent a chest ct  which showed no evidence of amiodaronepneumonitis or interstitial disease  and then was subsequentlystarted on amiodarone challenge in attempts to rhythm and ratecontrol of atrial fibrillation
E he was resistant to theamiodarone in terms of rate and rhythm control however  begandeveloping elevated lfts consistent with amiodarone hepatitis aswell as a persistent dry cough concerning for amiodaronepulmonary toxicity
E the amiodarone was stopped and he wasstarted on dofetilide at 125 mg po bid for correcting forhis creatinine clearance
E after 2 doses of dofetilide  heconverted to normal sinus rhythm and was rate controlled in the70s and 80s
E his qtc was followed twice a day and did not showany signs of prolongation
E he was finally being discharged ondofetilide for rate and rhythm control as he is now in normalsinus rhythm
E he will also go home on torsemide 60 mg pobid to maintain his dry weight
E he has been instructed tocontinue taking his glyburide  but not his metformin given hispoor creatinine clearance being discharged with a creatinine of16 and the fact that he is on metformin
E he will see hisprimary care doctor and will either likely be started on lowdoseinsulin or another oral hypoglycemic agent
E he will follow upwith his primary care doctor and dr rosasco for continuedtransplant evaluation
