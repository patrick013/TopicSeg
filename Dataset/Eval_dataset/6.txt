A history of present illness 
A this is a 54yearold female with ahistory of cardiomyopathy  hypertension  diabetes type 2 endstage renal disease on hemodialysis who had a reportedcardiac arrest while receiving dialysis on 8106 in heroutpatient clinic at richgo ster ha she began to feel nauseated andthen vomited
A the patient then reportedly went into vfib and wasshocked once by ems  resulting in a narrow qrs complex rhythm
A she was intubated  received amiodarone and dopamine  as her bp wasapproximately 70s systolic over palpable diastolic
A in the ed  a portablechest xray revealed diffuse bilateral opacities  risk of pulmonary edema andabg showed respiratory acidosis
A pt was transferred to the icu for furthermanagement
A of note  she was recently hospitalized at somver vasky university of medical center on 1506through 111107 for initiation of dialysis after her bun and creatininehad risen remarkably from baseline
A she was then asymptomatic atthat time
A a fistulogram and angioplasty of her right av fistulawas performed on 91406 with prednisone premedication but itwas unsuccessful and therefore a left ij tunneled dialysiscatheter was inserted on 101806 with the tip ending in theright atrium
A she has since received dialysis treatments with nocomplication
A past medical history

D her cvp at admission was 17 to 20
D the patient is an obese woman who wasintubated and responded to voice
D her pupils were 3 to 2 mmbilaterally
D her extraocular movements were intact
D her chestexam was notable for diffuse crackles throughout with good airmovement
D cardiac auscultation revealed regular rate and rhythmwith no murmurs  rubs or gallops
D her abdomen was soft nontender and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds
D extremities showed no edema
D distal pulses were not palpablebilaterally
D she has thickened hyperpigmented skinchanges on both feet
B laboratory data 
B significant labs on admission included a sodiumof 141  potassium 41  chloride of 102  bicarb of 31  bun 33 creatinine 42 with a glucose of 156
B her hematocrit was 32
B an abg at 10 pm of admission on fio2 of 60 revealed a ph of 736  pco2 of52  po2 91
B her first set of cardiac enzyme revealed acreatinine kinase of 116 and the mb fraction of 07 and troponint of less than assay and lactate of 18
B tox screen wasnegative

B imaging significant imaging at admission was an xray for chestxray revealing diffuse bilateral opacities  possible pulmonaryedema versus aspiration pneumonia  an ekg showing normal sinusrhythm 100 beats per minute with no acute st changes and oldtwave inversion in v2
E hospital course by problems 
E 1 question of vfib arrest
E whether or not the patient actuallyhad a vfib arrest seems to be in some doubt as she never had anarrhythmia on tele here by report and her troponin when peaked at014 on 8106 after receiving one external defibrillator shockat hemodialysis
E we believe what likely happened was a vagal event duringhemodialysis  possibly including a pause misread at vf by the defibrillator
E this explantation is supported by the observation that she has beencontinuously having nausea with dialysis and her known a historyof vasovagal episodes in the past
E echo on 8106 shows an efof 60 to 65 with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophyand no wall motion abnormalities
E the patient was continued ontelemetry and treated with her home dose of betablocker withgood response
E 2 volume status
E the patient is very close to her dry weightupon discharge  which she gives at 354 pounds by wet scale
E shehas been continued on hemodialysis with good results
E 3 possibly infected hemodialysis catheter
E the patient had asingle set of coagnegative staph positive blood cultures fromquinton catheter on 8806
E line was changed over wire42806 and was treated with vancomycin dose by renal levels
E the patient continued to grow out coagnegative staph  positiveblood cultures from 2 out of 2 sets drawn on 8806
E 4 anemia
E in the setting of endstage renal disease herbaseline hematocrit is about 30 and stable
E 5 diabetes type 2
E she was treated with a portland protocolduring her icu course wand was switched to a long andshortacting subcutaneous insulin approaching her home dose of nph bid6 fen
E the patient was gradually advanced to an oral diet withno signs of aspiration status post extubation
E 7 prophylaxis
E the patient received heparin subcutaneously andnexium
E 8 code
E the patient is full code
E her healthcare proxy is herson noble schomberg  0308556086
