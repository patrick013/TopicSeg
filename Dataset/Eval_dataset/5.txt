D heent examination revealedmoist mucous membranes without lesions
D pupils were equal  round and reactive to light
D extraocular muscles were intact
D neck hadno lad or jvd
D lungs had crackles present with egophony and e to achange over the right low lateral lung field  otherwise  clear toauscultation bilaterally
D heart had an irregular rhythm with aregular rate
D there was a iivi systolic ejection murmur at theright upper sternal border and left lower sternal border
D therewas normal s1 and s2  no s3 or s4
D abdomen was soft  nontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds
D extremities revealed1+ bilateral pitting edema with bilateral changes of chronicvenostasis  1+ pedal pulses on the left  but left foot slightlycool to touch
D there was no palpable pulse in the right lowerextremity  but good capillary refill and warm
D neurologicalexamination revealed cranial nerves iixii were intact bilaterally
D motor was intact bilaterally
D sensory was intact to light touchwith decrease in sensory to light touch bilateral lowerextremities
D deep tendon reflexes were 2+ bilaterally
B laboratory data 
B white blood cell count was 2112  hematocrit388  and platelets 191
B inr was 21  ptt 423
B sodium was 136  potassium 42  chloride 98  bicarbonate 25  bun 16 creatinine 12  and glucose 279
B admission ekg was significant foratrial fibrillation at 76 beats per minute with evidence for coldleft bundle branch block
B chest xray was significant for rightmiddle lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia
E hospital course 
E the patient was admitted to the floor foradministration of intravenous antibiotics
E thepatient did well overnight
E in the am of 02397  the patienthad an episode of hypoxia with increased requirement for oxygen andultimately required 100 face mask for 93 o2 saturation
E thepatient denied any anginal chest pain  nausea  vomiting  orincreased shortness of breath
E a stat ekg revealed no changes
E stat chest xray revealed bilateral pulmonary edema
E thisresponded well to iv lasix
E however  the patient continued torequire increased amounts of oxygen over the next two days whereinhe had further episodes of pulmonary edema requiring prn
E ivlasix
E during this time  blood cultures from the time of admissiongrew out pneumococcus times two which were sensitive to penicillin
E the patients broad coverage antibiotics were then changed to ivpenicillin
E an echocardiogram obtained on 02397 revealed a highnormal left ventricular size with mild concentric hypertrophy hypokinesis with inferior septum  and inferior posterior region ejection fraction 45  normal rv size and function  left atrialenlargement  mild to moderate mitral regurgitation  and no aorticstenosis or insufficiency
E the patient was initiated on captoprilwhich was then increased titrating with the patients bloodpressure over his hospital stay
E the patient  during his hospitalcourse  was also noted to have increased blood sugars to the 450range
E therefore  he was started on a sliding scale insulinregimen
E the patient improved with regards to his hypoxia and  on themorning of 0497  he was breathing room air with an o2saturation of 93
E his lung examination was significant for onlyrare rhonchi on the right side
E chest xray of 51697 revealedimprovement of his right lung pneumonia with persistence ofbilateral effusions consistent with his episodes of pulmonaryedema
E fingerstick glucose was 164 reflecting an overallimprovement and decreased need for sliding scale insulin
E thepatient was felt to be well and ready for discharge
