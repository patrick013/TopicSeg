E hospital course 
E by problemscongestive heart failure the patient underwent a rule outmyocardial infarction protocol and subsequently did rule out
E after that he had an exercise echo
E the patient exercised forthree minutes on a modified bruce  achieving a maximum heart rateof 97 and a blood pressure of 160
E the test was stopped because ofknee pain and shortness of breath
E baseline images prior toexercise showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy  with overallnormal function
E there were no resting wall motion abnormalities
E stress images obtained after peak exercise showed a suggestion of aposterobasilar hypokinesis
E no other wall motion abnormalitieswere noted
E it was felt that this findings were questionable fornonspecific finding or ischemia
E it was felt that the ekg portionof the ett showed no evidence for ischemia
E the patient wasdiuresed gently with iv lasix and his shortness of breath improved
E hypertension on admission  the patients blood pressure wasapproximately 220110
