A history of present illness 
A the patient with known multiplemedical problems presents with difficulty breathing

A the patients recent past medical history is remarkablefor a fall with cervical fractures rib fractures and subsequenthemothorax for which she was admitted to the educarepullman icu over theend of december through the beginning of january
A the patientschest tube was withdrawn approximately 10 days ago and thepatient has been doing well at rehab since
A however today wasnoted to have desaturations to 80 on room air
A she hadshortness of breath as well
A her oxygen saturations improvedmarginally on oxygenation and have been responsive tononrebreather treatment in the transport here
A the patient wastreated with nebulizers and lasix without significant improvementand is noted to be quite tachypneic

D physical examination 
D the patient is awake and alert in somedegree of respiratory distress however able to interact andanswer questions in 12 word sentences
D vital signs are asdocumented with an elevated blood pressure of 17696 pulse 76and oxygen saturation is 98 on nonrebreather
D heent exam isatraumatic normal to inspection
D the patient has a large tongueand her uvula is not visible at all
D neck is immobilized in accollar and is obese
D respiratory exam reveals decreased breathsounds diffusely with tachypnea and respiratory muscle accessoryuse
D cardiovascular exam  regular rate and rhythm withoutmurmur
D pulses are palpable in all four extremities
D abdomen issoft and nontender obese but without any organomegaly ormasses or guarding or rebound
D skin is intact warm and drywithout any lesions or rash
D musculoskeletal exam revealstenderness over the right ribs where the patient has known ribfractures
D neurologically she is oriented with difficultyspeaking due to respiratory distress but no focal neurologicdeficit
B laboratory studies 
B bnp is elevated in the 500600 range
B whiteblood count is slightly elevated at 10 hematocrit 263 which isat the patients baseline and creatinine of 22
B lfts withinnormal limit
B inr 12
B ddimer significantly elevated
B ekgdemonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific stt wave changes
E emergency department course 
E the patient was initially givenlasix and nitro with improvement in her blood pressure and wasalso started on cpap
E she seemed to be improving clinically forsome period of time but then began to decline in her mentalstatus
E at that time an abg was sent demonstrating hypoxia
E prior to those results the decision was made that the patientlikely needed intubation
E we had hope to hold off to do athoracentesis however the patients clinical course declinessuch that it was not possible for her to sit up for theprocedure
E on cpap the patients oxygen saturations were stablethroughout in the 90s but she developed increasing respiratorydistress
E intubation was complicated by her inability to flexher neck her large tongue and her body habitus was successfulin two attempts with one episode of bag mask ventilation inbetween those attempts
E for full details of the procedureplease see the attached procedure note
E thoracic surgery wasconsulted
E they arrived as the patient was being intubated
E atthis time their recommendation is for a ct scan of the chest todetermine whether this is more likely a hemothorax or a pleuraleffusion and whether it is loculated
E this study will beperformed and then patient will be admitted to her ready bed inthe icu
E a bedside ultrasound was also performed by myself andthe resident demonstrating no obvious pericardial effusion
