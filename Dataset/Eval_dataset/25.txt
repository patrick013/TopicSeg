A history of present illness and hospital course 
A ms scorzelli is72yearold female with a history of hypercholesterolemia  typeii diabetes mellitus  past smoking  and questionablehypertension  but no known cardiac disease  who presented to thishospital with vague epigastric painchest pain exacerbated bydeep inspiration and on lying flat
A the pain persisted for morethan 48 hours  1010 in intensity and prevented her from sleepfinally leading to her presentation to the emergency departmenton august  2005  where ekg showed q waves in the anteriorleads with st elevation in inferior leads ii  iii  and avf
A shehad elevated enzymes
A her troponin peaked to 20
A a bedsidetransthoracic echo showed anterior wall motion abnormality
A shewas started on aspirin  heparin  plavix  integrilin  andlopressor  and the patient was taken to the catheterization labwhere she was found to have a 100 proximal lad lesion and a hazy90 lesion to the ramus
A two cypher stents were deployed to thelad
A the procedure is complicated by noreflow phenomenon
A onecypher stent was placed in the ramus branch
A right heartcatheterization revealed ra of 12  rv 367  pa 3818  and nostepup in oxygenation in the right heart
A the patient wastransferred to the ccu where her chest pain persisted
A the painwas positional  increased by deep inspiration and it was felt tobe likely postmi pericarditis
A her ekg changes persisted  buther enzymes clearly were trending downwards
A the diagnosis ofpostmi pericarditis is consistent with echo findings showingadhesions between the myocardium and pericardium
A anechocardiogram obtained after the percutaneous coronaryintervention showed an lvef of 35
A the left ventricular sizewas normal
A the right ventricle was normal in size and thethickness of the right ventricle was also normal
A there was mildtricuspid regurgitation
A there was mild pericardial thickeningwith the areas of adhesions at the pericardium near the apex andthere was a trivial pericardial effusion
A also  a mural sessilethrombus was observed near the apex of the heart
A her ekgchanges continued to show st elevation in lead ii  iii  avf  v2through v6  q waves in d2  d3  and avf  and she also intermittentright bundlebranch block morphology
A she was treated forischemia with ace inhibitors and betablockers titrated toachieve a pulse in the 70s to 80s
A we did not increase itfurther because of her low ejection fraction she was unlikely totolerate such high doses
A she was started on aspirin and plavix which she continued for her myocardial function
A she was placedon eplerenone and lasix to achieve a dry weight estimated to be78 kilograms
A this should be her goal weight
A she has also beenreceiving captopril  ace inhibitors  for left ventricularremodeling
A rhythm wise  there has been no arrhythmia noted ontelemetry on which she has been throughout her hospital stay
A for her pericarditis  she initially received 650 mg of aspirin 4times a day
A she was continued on this  but later the dose wasreduced as other anticoagulants were started
A she was giventramadol for her pain with improvement of her pericarditis pain
A given her mural thrombus  she was anticoagulated initially withheparin achieving the therapeutic ptt of 80 secondsapproximately
A she was later bridged to coumadin with a targetinr of 2 a higher inr should be avoided thus to avoidhemopericardium
A endocrine wise  she was treated for herdiabetes with an insulin regimen that consists of lantus andregular insulin
A a cardiac mri was obtained on february  2005 with following findings
A she had moderate to global leftventricular dysfunction with basal to distal and anteroseptalakinesis  apical akinesis  and distal inferior dyskinesis
A herestimated ef was 38
A there is fullthickness delayedenhancement of the myocardium indicating a 7th segment  out ofthe total of 17 segments  myocardial infarction
A there was alarge area of noreflow within the myocardial infarction  whichis consistent with microvascular thrombosis
A the distal or thefree wall is also hypokinetic raising the possibility of rightventricular involvement from the myocardia l infarction
A aconcentric moderatesized pericardial effusion with exudativefeatures was also seen
A the thickest area of the pericardialeffusion appears to be on the dependent aspect measuring 12 mm inthickness
A there is no right ventricular or right atrialcollapse or compression
A renal wise  she had no issues
A hercreatinine was always below 1  mostly 07 or 08
