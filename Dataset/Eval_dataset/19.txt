E hospital course 
E problem 1  headache
E the patient has a historyof chronic headaches for which she was maintainedon fioricet in the past
E over the first week of hospitalization she complained of increasing headache that prevented her fromlooking into the light as well as prevented her from ambulating outof the bed
E at times  she complained of intermittent visualsymptoms
E these headaches were not completely relieved by demerol percocet or tylenol
E she was eventually tried on fioricet whichapparently produced good relief of the headaches
E she was seen byneurology and noted with a questionably abnormal neuro exam withfindings localized to the right side
E apparently she has a historyof this abnormality in the past
E a ct scan revealed what wasapparently old damage from the previous motor vehicle accident
E anmri was entirely within normal limits
E she refused a lumbarpuncture
E at this time  the headaches are thought to be eithervascular in origin or psychogenic
E she was continued on fioricetat the time of discharge
E problem 2  hypertension
E she hadelevated blood pressures of 150160 over as high as 110 uponadmission
E she has a history of chronic hypertension in the pastand was at least briefly maintained on hydrochlorothiazide before
E she had a negative work up for pet  including repeat 24 hour urinesand repeat pet labs
E as well  she had no physical findingsconsistent with pet
E given her history of chronic hypertension  wefelt this was most likely chronic hypertension aggravated bypregnancy
E she was begun on a beta blocker  namely labetolol  withgood control
E she was discharged to home on labetolol
E problem3  history of seizure disorder
E she carries the diagnosis of aseizure disorder  although this is  at least recently  poorlydocumented
E she has been on valproic acid in the past and has beentaking a small dose of valproic acid apparently on her ownthroughout this pregnancy
E she has been taking 250 mg a week
E shelast noted an obvious seizure three years ago
E it is not clearthat this was witnessed by anyone else
E while in the hospital  shehad an eeg which suggested some slowing in the right parietalregion
E there was no clear seizure activity seen on eeg
E shecalled us to her room on several episodes which she described asseizures
E these seizures were witnessed by several physicians andwere remarkable for absence of a postictal period as well asabnormal idiosyncratic behaviors during the events
E it was ourfeeling that these were not true seizures
E indeed  reviewing herchart  she has had episodes of what have been called pseudoseizuressimilar to these in the past
E given her multiple drug allergies including dilantin  phenobarb and tegretol  we felt limited in ourtherapeutic options
E we did elect to increase her dose of valproicacid as this has apparently been effective in the past
E she willcontinue this as an outpatient
E problem 4  nausea and vomiting
E she complained of persistent nausea and vomiting during the latterpart of her hospitalization and declined to take anything po
E theetiology of this nausea and vomiting was unclear  althoughapparently associated with some diarrhea
E as much as was possible work up for an organic cause of the problem was negative
E weelected initially to treat her with intravenous hydration  however she declined further ivs
E in fact  she became quite vocal in herdemand to go home
E she understands our concerns as to the risks ofpoor po intake and insists she will be able to take in pos athome
E given her feelings in this regard  we have elected todischarge her for a trial of outpatient management
E follow up willbe in the clinic
E should she show evidence of compromise ordehydration  she will be readmitted
E problem 5  psychosocial
E the patient has been seen several times in the past for behavioraldisorders
E it is difficult to sort out what part of hersymptomatology is organic and what  if any  is inorganic
E she wasseen by psychiatry during her stay here who felt that she had asignificant conflict in her home life
E we have counseled her asmuch as possible throughout her stay
E she has seen both socialservices and psychiatry  however  she is at best reluctant to availherself of these services
E our plan at the time of discharge isfor follow up with dss
E as well  we have emphasized ouravailability to the patient at all times and tried to be assupportive as possible in these circumstances
