E hospital course 
E on 92905  the patient was brought to the operating room forcritical aortic stenosis  acute coronary syndrome and acutepulmonary edema
E he underwent an aortic valve replacement with a21 carpentieredwards magna valve  as well as a coronary arterybypass graft x1 with lima to lad
E bypass time was 120 minutesand crossclamp time 90 minutes
E two atrial wires and oneventricular wire was placed
E please see the operative note forfurther details
E the patient tolerated the procedure well
E hewas extubated with without incident on postoperative day 1
E hisneurologic status was in time and he did not suffer any deliriumas witnessed after his initial emergence from anesthesia duringthe renal transplantation
E he was noted to have significant oralsecretions  but these were clear and thin
E on postoperative day1  his femoral arterial line was removed and his renaltransplantation medications restarted
E his ckmb peaked at 46and did trend down thereafter
E on postoperative day 2  he hadbegun to be diuresed in light persistent pulmonary edema and seenby chest xray
E his chest tubes were removed without incident
E on postoperative day 3  he was hemodynamically stable
E his fklevels were noted to be low  as is historically the case withhim
E renal transplant medicine was following and did titratedhis medications as necessary
E on postoperative day 4  his finalleft chest tube was removed
E postpull chest xray showed thelung to be well expanded
E he was found to be hyponatremic with asodium of approximately 130
E he was begun on fluid restrictionof 15 liters for hematocrit of 21
E a 1 unit of packed red bloodcells was also given at this time and he was continued ondiuresis
E on postoperative day 5  as his preoperatively weighthad been reached  he was taken off of diuresis
E his renaltransplantation medications discontinue
E the patient was up outof bed and ambulating well
E the patient was also noted to have alarge sacral decubitus ulcer  without exposure of bone
E thisulcer was the result of the previous admission in march afterrenal transplantation
E the plastic surgery service was consultedand their recommendations included appropriate therapeuticsupport surface  frequent turning with minimization of being inthe seated position  optimization of nutrition  and wettodrydressings to the wound
E the service is still following thepatient and will consider vac dressing and the later time
