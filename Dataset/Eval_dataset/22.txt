B laboratory data 
B on admission showed a normal sma7
B herhematocrit was 415 with a low mcv at 787  lowmch at 313  and a rdw of 161
B the patient ruled out for amyocardial infarction with normal cks
B her chest xray showed aglobular heart  question of some cardiomegaly  clearly postcoronary artery bypass graft with lots of clips
B she had rightatrial enlargement with loss of the retrosternal air space  but noevidence of aortic widening of the mediastinum
B no pulmonaryedema  no pulmonary vascular redistribution was detected
B ekgshowed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with a pr interval of 14  qrs11
B  and a qt of 45
B she had left atrial enlargement  old lateraltwave inversions as well as inferior twave inversions
B thepatient had no acute changes
E hospital course 
E involved placing the patient on a cardiacmonitor  rule her out for an myocardialinfarction  obtaining exercise stress test  echocardiogram  drawingblood for thyroid function tests  vmas  metanephrines in theurine
E in addition  a beta blocker was added to her hypertensiveregimen  and she was started on an aspirin a day
E her cardiacmonitor demonstrated no dysrhythmias except for a few pvcs
E theresults of the 24 hour holter on discharge were still pending
E sheruled out for a myocardial infarction
E an exercise stress testshowed that the patient went 5 minutes and 45 seconds on a standardbruce protocol  no ischemic symptoms  stopped due to leg pains
E ekg was with 1 mm upsloping st depressions in v4 and v5
E it wasreportedly consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia
E becauseof this  the patient should probably have an exercise mibi on theoutside as an outpatient
E an echocardiogram demonstrated anejection fraction of 4550  severe hypokinesis of theanterolateral and posterior wall  akinesis of the inferior wall 23+ mitral regurgitation  and an intraatrial septal aneurysm  notumor or thrombus was detected
E laboratory studies on admission did demonstrate an elevated proteinof 85 and a globulin fraction of 42
E therefore  an spep  iggand igms were sent and were pending on discharge
C medications on discharge 
C isordil 10 mg tid
C cardizem 60 mg qid
C  lopressor 25 mg bid
