A history of present illness 
A this 61yearold ambidextrous female is referred by dr orellana for followup of possible stroke or tia
A the patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed
A in february she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning
A there was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg
A this seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion she fell getting out of bed
A the symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated
A she attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected she feels that the event has not reoccured
A the second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well
A she was seen by neurology on 021043 after she was admitted
A the history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report
A initially mri of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe
A also in the record is noted that at the time of the second event her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with d50
A there was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event
A on examination at the time of admission there were no clear findings
A mri was said to show periventricular white matter changes
A the area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage
A mra of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right pca about 1 cm beyond its origin but mra of the neck showed no significant changes
A subsequent echocardiogram showed mild lvh with no evidence of a shunt
A currently the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup
A it has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was
A some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic tia given the changes in the right pca on mra
A another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor
A there is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage
