E hospital course

E abdominal ct is consistent with an infectiousinflammatory bowel process
E given history of c diff colitis  cdiff was the most likely infectious etiology  but others werepossible
E ischemic colitis was considered secondary to lowforward flow  given patients cardiomyopathy and low ejectionfraction of 20 to 35 and he also got a pattern of inflammatorycolitis or nonspecific colitis
E stool samples were sent for a cdiff toxin and assay and all were negative x at least 3 samples
E stool cultures were sent and did not grow anything out duringadmission
E empiric treatment was started with po vancomycin
E patients abdominal pain continued to improve and completelyresolved

E advance patients diet as toleratedand by discharge the patient was up to soft solids
E we addedlactobacillus po for probiotics and patient also had flex sigtwo days before discharge  showing resolving inflammationconsistent with colitis of inflammatory etiology
