A this has progressively worsened until the date of admission whenswelling had progressed up to his waist
A in the last 23 weeks  healso noted slow worsening of his exertional dyspnea
A prior tothis  he was rarely limited by shortness of breath  but does notexert himself much
A recently  however  exercise tolerance hasdecreased to 3 to 50 feet on flat ground

D heent showedpupils were equal  round  reactive to light
D extracular movementsintact
D oropharynx was clear
D neck showed jvp above the jaw witha question of a waves
D chest showed decreased breath sounds at thebases bilaterally with bibasilar crackles
D cardiac exam wasregularly irregular s1  s2  + s3 and s4  26 pansystolic murmur tothe apex
D abdominal exam was soft  nontender  nondistended  with apalpable liver edge  nonpulsatile
D no splenomegaly
D extremitiesshowed 3+ bilateral pitting edema
D distal pulses were not palpablebilaterally
D femoral pulses 2+ bilaterally
D neurologic exam wasgrossly nonfocal
D chest xray revealed cardiomegaly with pulmonaryvascular redistribution and perivascular cuffing
D ekg showedatrial flutter with 21 block at a rate of 135 withintraventricular conduction delay with right bundle branch blockpattern  as well as poor r wave progression
E hospital course 
E 1 cardiovascular
E after patient had beentreated with procainamide in the emergency room he became hypotensive and was subsequently cardioverted
E his bloodpressure recovered to his baseline of 90 systolic and he wasstarted on ace inhibitors
E he was also treated with iv lasix andstarted on heparin
E because of his disproportionate rightventricular failure  he did undergo a vq scan which was lowprobability
E patient had recurrent episodes of atrial tachycardia and was loadedorally with amiodarone
E in addition  he had some short runs ofnonsustained ventricular tachycardia
E after aggressive diuresis  the patient was noted to have anincreasing buncreatinine
E he was started on iv dobutamine on25 of october and was continued on captopril and isordil
E he diuresed wellon dobutamine and was restarted on digoxin
E the dobutamine wasweaned to off on 28 of may he was restarted on iv lasix
E on 9 of april  patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a40 mid lad lesion  40 om  40 rca
E his pressures showed an rapressure of 10  rv 5012  with a mean pa pressure of 34  apulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22  cardiac output 30  withan index of 16  svr 1800
E it was therefore felt that hiscardiomyopathy which had initially been attributed to ischemicetiology  was likely idiopathic or secondary to alcohol
E thepatient was subsequently transferred to the kh with swanganzcatheter in place
E he was again treated with dobutamine andisordil and his captopril was titrated upwards
E repeat echo showedan ejection fraction of 20 with an unstable lv thrombus
E he wassubsequently restarted on heparin  followed by loading withcoumadin
E he was transferred back to the floor on 24 of june andremained hemodynamically stable on captopril  isordil  amiodarone digoxin and aspirin
E his lasix intravenous was converted to potorsemide with good fluid balance
E 2 neurology
E the patient was noted to complain oflightheadedness  vertigo and ringing in his ears after receivinghis doses of captopril
E he underwent noninvasive carotids whichshowed a subtotal occlusion of his right internal carotid artery
E he underwent combined cardiac catheterization and carotidangiography on 28 of may angiography revealed a greater than 90 rightinternal carotid stenosis
E following the procedure  he had atransient 510 minute episode of decreased responsiveness anddecreased left hand grip  which resolved completely
E on 16 of may he underwent right carotid endarterectomy complicated by a smallright neck hematoma which resolved spontaneously
E he had nofurther symptoms and was able to tolerate captopril up to 25 mgtid3 hematology
E the patient was anticoagulated with heparinfollowed by coumadin as above  for his lv thrombus  with a targetinr of 25 to 34 noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus
E patients bloodsugars were well controlled on po glyburide
E 5 renal
E patients creatinine on admission was 14
E hiscreatinine transiently rose to 22 with aggressive diuresis  butfell to 14 on discharge
E the patient was discharged home with vna services on 26 of may hewas stable on discharge
E he is to follow up with dr seth scheirman on 23 of august
