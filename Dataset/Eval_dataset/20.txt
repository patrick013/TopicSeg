E hospital course 
E patient was admitted for a rule out myocardialinfarction for the substernal chest pain althoughthere was a low index of suspicion for heart attack
E she ruled outby ck and had no ekg changes
E phc cardiology felt that this chestpain was not related to her heart or ischemic cause and left it upto the primary provider  dr dorset  to arrange for an outpatientexercise stress test if felt necessary
E most likely  the chestpain represented some type of gastroesophageal reflux disease andthe patient was restarted on axid
E another issue was question ofnew neurologic deficits although the original head ct showed noevidence of stroke
E the stroke may have been too early to detectleaving diagnosis of either a new cerebrovascular accident  amanifestation of a seizure  or a conversion reaction secondary toher borderline personality
E her primary deficit remained theslowing of speech without actual slurring of speech and without anydeficits in understanding or expression
E a lumbar puncture wasdone on the second day of hospitalization with a mildly elevatedprotein in the sixties and a glucose in the 120 range
E cell countwas low not consistent with infection
E a cardiac echo was alsodone which showed normal left ventricular function without anysegmantal wall motion abnormalities  there was a question of leftventricular hypertrophy  and carotid dopplers were done whichshowed no significant disease in the internal carotid arteries however  there was a mild left internal carotid artery plaque
E patients neurologic status remained stable during herhospitalization
E she was started on aspirin on admission
E aftermuch discussion with nmh neurology as well as with dr talboti  itwas felt that the patient could be followed as an outpatient
