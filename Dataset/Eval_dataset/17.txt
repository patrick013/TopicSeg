A her exam revealed bibasilar rales left greater than the right
A her abdominal exam revealednontender and nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds
A her extremities revealed warm
A she had bilateral below the kneeamputations
A her cardiovascular exam revealed regular rate andrhythm with the 26 systolic murmur
A past medical history 
A significant for chronic renal insufficiency  endstage renaldisease on hemodialysis  insulindependent diabetes  cva bilateral below the knee amputations  cad  status post mi in23  hypertension  and peripheral vascular disease

B herwhite count was 8 her hematocrit was 362  and her plateletswere 298  000
B her inr was 13
B her ekg revealed a regular rateand rhythm
B normal axis
B twave inversions and flattenings inthe lateral leads on low voltage in the limb leads
B her chestxray showed left lower lobe consolidation and left effusion
E hospital course by system 
E cardiovascular upon admission  the patient had a slighttroponin leak
E it was unclear for initial presenting symptoms orsubsequent secondary to ischemia
E on her second hospital day she developed hypotension
E initially  her systolic bloodpressure dropped to the 80s and her blood pressure medicines wereheld
E subsequently  her blood pressure dropped into the 70s andshe required dopamine and was transferred to the cardiac careunit
E in the cardiac care unit  she was started on the dopaminedrip of 10 mcgkgminute
E in the cardiac care unit  the initialdifferential diagnoses were hypertension was cardiogenic versusseptic physiology
E however  her white count revealed significantelevation of 246 with bandemia  10 bands
E she also had anelevated lactate of 93 concerning for gi etiology
E possibly gutischemia was the cause of her infection
E she was covered broadlywith amp  vanc  levo  and flagyl
E she subsequently required theaddition of neosynephrine as a second pressor agent to maintainher blood pressure
E dopamine was weaned off
E however  on thesecond day in the ccu  on 4205  the patient developed suddenhypotension
E physicians were called to see the patient and atthat time she was found to have no palpable pulse
E code wasinitiated
E the patient was found to be in pulseless electricalactivity
E chest compressions were initiated  and she was maskventilated  and she received multiple rounds of epinephrine andatropine
E she received 2 amps of bicarbonate and 1 amp ofcalcium gluconate given concern for hyperkalemia in the settingof endstage renal disease
E anesthesia then arrived and thepatient was intubated
E despite all efforts  the patients rhythmdeteriorated to asystole  and she was pronounced dead at 530pm on 4205  which was the time of death
