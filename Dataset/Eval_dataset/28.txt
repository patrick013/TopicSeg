A history of present illness 
A mr barriger is a 73yearold gentleman who is a restrained driverin a single car motor vehicle collision  in which the car wentoff the road at a moderate rate of speed  approximately 45 milesan hour   and struck a telephone pole
A there are no skin marksnoted at the scene
A there was airbag deployment  and the patientwas wearing a seatbelt
A the patient reports feeling fine priorto the motor vehicle collision
A however  he has no recollectionof the motor vehicle collision itself  and the next thing heremembers is waking up and finding the airbag is deployed  andbeing in severe pain
A he does remember ems arriving
A upon arrival of the ems  he was found to have a heart rate of 30in a thirddegree av block
A the patient denies any chest pain shortness of breath  nausea or vomiting before the motor vehiclecollision
A he also denies any fevers  chills  night sweats shortness of breath  headaches or visual changes either before orafter
A he had no recent changes in any doses of his medications
A he was also complaining of knee pain
E ed course 
E in the emergency department  he was seen by thetrauma team
E a full dictation of the emergency departmentcourses has been completed
E please see the computer for furtherdetails of this dictation
E however  in brief  he had numerouscat scans performed while in the emergency department
E theseincluded a cat scan of the abdomen and pelvis  head  and chest
E there was also a ct of the cervicothoracic and lumbar spine  withreconstructions performed
E as well as plain xrays films of thelower extremity as well a pelvis  cspine  and chest
E ofsignificance  the plain films of the knee were negative
E the catscan of the chest demonstrated a right frontal periventricularhypodensity  which was thought to represent a subacute infarct
E he was subsequently admitted to the cardiac stepdown floor
E hewas seen by the neurology service  dr orban  who is theneurology resident   who initially saw him

B there was also some supraclavicular stranding alongthe left side  without any evidence of vessel injury
B ct of theabdomen and pelvis is negative  except for a ruptured renal cyst
B he was also incidentally noted to show diverticulosis  withoutany diverticulitis
B the ct of the thoracic and lumbar spinesalso demonstrated no fractures  although there were incidentallynoted to be anterior osteophytes in numerous levels
B ct of thechest demonstrated the rib fractures  but was otherwise negative
B laboratory  sodium 138  potassium 44  chloride 103  bicarbonate25  bun 28  creatinine 13  glucose 185  and anion gap is 10  astand alt are 20 and 25 respectively
B alkaline phosphatase is 80lipase is 51
B calcium is 88  the albumin is 46  the ck is 89 ckmb is 36  and troponin was less than assay
B his serumtoxicology screen was negative for aspirin  tylenol benzodiazepine  barbiturates  and tricyclics
B urine drug screenis also negative
B pt  ptt  and inr were 13  258  and 09respectively
B cbc was significant for white count of 120 hemoglobin and hematocrit were 146 and 422  and platelets are250
B urinalysis was negative
B review of the prehospital ekg demonstrated a complete thirddegree  heart block
B however  ekg done immediately uponadmission to the trauma bay demonstrated a bifascicular block with a rate in the 40s
E hospital course by systems 
E 1 cardiovascular he was admitted to the cardiac stepdownunit
E he had zoll pacer pads were placed upon his chest  andatropine remained at his bedside
E he also had an additional zollpacer pads  as well as the pacemaker standby at the bedside however  these were not needed  as he has completed asymptomaticwith his bifascicular block
E he had serial enzymes  which wereperformed  he was ruled out for myocardial infarction
E he wentto the cardiac cath lab  which demonstrated some coronary arterydisease
E please see the dictated cardiology reports for thefindings of the cath lab
E it was felt  however  this wasunchanged from prior studies
E he also went to theelectrophysiology lab
E they were unable to induce anyventricular tachycardia or other dysrhythmias during theprolonged ep studies
E he had a pacemaker inserted
E thepacemaker was followed by the electrophysiology service  and wasfound to be working adequately
E the attending was dr matt duropan  with the electrophysiology service
E dr caires with thecardiology service saw him and was attending on record2 neurology he was seen by the neurology service
E so  thiswas under dr edgardo mccorison  the attending neurologist on thecase
E he had an mrimra performed of his head and neck
E thediffusionweighted images demonstrated no evidence of anyabnormality
E there was a region of increase signal intensity onthe t2 and flair images  involving the vasoganglion  extendingthe corona radiata
E therefore  given the fact that signal wasseen on the t2 and flair  not on the diffusionweighted  it wasfelt that this was at least 10 days old
E therefore  this was notfelt to be either the cause nor an affect of the motor vehiclecollision
E it was most likely represented an old cva  which wasnot previously detected
E given the fact that the patientremained asymptomatic  and had a normal neurological exam  andradiographic data demonstrated that this infarct was more than 10days old  and this was not further addressed
E an mra of his headand neck demonstrated tortuous vertebrobasilar system
E themrimra of the neck was essentially normal  however  the leftbifurcation was thought to be without any significant stenosis
E the right bifurcation is probably without significant stenosis however  could not be completed excluded
E given artifact  thiscould be further followed up with an outpatient venous duplex ofthe carotid arteries
E 3 musculoskeletal he was seen by the orthopedic service inthe emergency department at the time of the trauma  he ultimatelyhad an mri that was performed of his knee
E this showed tears ofthe medial and lateral menisci
E there was no evidence offracture
E he remained in a knee immobilizer
E he saw physicaltherapy  which felt that further therapy would be indicated
E with the impression of the orthopedic service that no acuteintervention was needed  and that he should followup with sportsmedicine or orthopedics in approximately 34 weeks
E in addition he was noted to have several rib fractures
E the rib fractureswere felt to be the source of his pain  he continue to complainof some inspiratory pain throughout his chest
E however  headamantly denied any pain throughout his chest wall uponinspiring
E it was therefore felt that given the negative enzymesand the negative cath  and the known rib fractures that the chestpain was strictly a result of a musculoskeletal pain
E this painwas well controlled with the combination of dilaudid andoxycodone
E he was encouraged to take several deep breaths perhour to reduce the risk of atelectasis or pneumonia
E 4 infectious disease there was no evidence of any acuteinfection
E of note  his white count was trending upwards  on thelast two days of admission
E it was felt that this probablyrepresented stress  given all the recent procedures that weredone  including the catheterization and the electrophysiologystudies  rather than a2 infection
E the chest xray was performedon the 25th  which demonstrated no infiltrate
E this was reviewedwith an attending radiologist who reported low lung volumes
E otherwise  it was essentially negative
E in addition  a repeaturinalysis was performed
E the results are pending at the time ofdictation  however  will be followed up prior to the patientsdischarge from the hospital
E the patient appears well  andstates that he is feeling at his best since the accident
E however  further workup for his white count is not performed atthe present time  however  the patient is informed  as the no hospital and the discharge summary  which show that the patientseem to develop any evidence of infection that he should bereevaluated by a physician
E 5 nutrition the patient is able to eat without anydifficulty
E he was eating regular house diabeticcardiac diet
E 6 hypercholesterolemia he was continued on his zocorthroughout the hospitalization
E 7 prophylaxis he was initially treated with lovenox 40 mgsubq
E q day for a prophylaxis against dvts
E he is also onaspirin and plavix for secondary cardiac and neurologicalprophylaxis
E the lovenox is discontinued  at the request of theelectrophysiology service on the 24th
E 8 endocrine given the numerous contrast studies  initiallyhis metformin was held
E however  he was later restarted on this
E in addition  he was continued on his glyburide and covered withsliding scale insulin
E his blood sugar was never any significantproblem during his hospitalization
E 9 disposition the patient will be going to missp medical center  instable condition
E at the rehab  he will continue to get physicaltherapy  which he has received in the hospital
E it was felt thata short course of rehab would benefit the patient to allow him togo back living independently again
E he will be discharged to therehab in stable condition
