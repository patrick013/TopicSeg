A history of present illness 
A patient was in her usual state ofhealth until the day of admission whenshe had sudden onset of increased vertigo  dizziness  and nearsyncope as well as left leg weakness and dysarthria
A she had amild frontal headache  no palpitations  no chest pain  and noshortness of breath
A these symptoms lasted two to three hours withslow gradual improvement
A she phoned her egmc doctor who referredher to moness medical center 
A on admission  she complainedof no residual symptoms
A she had no visual changes  no amaurosis no paresthesias or numbness  and was feeling at her baseline
A herhistory  of pertinence  in 1988  she had a syncopal episode
A aholter at that time revealed some atrial fibrillation andnonsustained ventricular tachycardia for which she was started onatenolol
A in 1990  she had a villous adenoma diagnosed andunderwent an abdominoperineal resection complicated bypostoperative atrial fibrillation
A she ruled out for myocardialinfarction at that time
A for the past year  she has describedintermittent episodes of dizziness  so called room spinning  andfatigue lasting for a few minutes occurring only once a month
A shehas no other significant past medical history besides hypertension

E hospital course 
E the impression on admission was that this was a75 year old white female with a history ofhypertension and a history of atrial fibrillation  nonsustained who presents with a two to three hour episode of vertigo and leftsided weakness which spontaneously resolved
E she was admitted forfurther evaluation of this transient ischemic attack thought to bedue either a vertebovascular insufficiency syndrome  anteriorcirculation  carotid stenosis  or an embolus from a cardiac source
E neurology was consulted and  in addition  she was entered on a ruleout protocol for a myocardial infarction
E her abnormal urinalysiswas also of concern despite her lack of symptoms and she wasafebrile
E repeat urinalysis was ordered and urine was sent forculture and sensitivity
E hospital course over the next few days the patient remained completely asymptomatic except for anoccasional complaint of mild palpitations  occasional vertigo  andoccasional frontal headache
E she was started on coumadin onhospital day number two for which she entered therapeutic range byhospital day number four
E on hospital day number two  she had aholter placed which showed normal sinus rhythm for 24 hours exceptfor one fivebeat run of ventricular tachycardia and two episodesof atrial fibrillationflutter  the longest lasting thirteen beats
E on hospital day number two  she had an echocardiogram which showedconcentric left ventricular hypertrophy without evidence ofthrombus or valvular disease
E on hospital day number four  she hada carotid noninvasive study which revealed completely patentcarotid arteries without evidence of stenosis or atheroscleroticlesions
E on hospital day number five  she had a magnetic resonanceimaging of her head with angiogram  the results of which werepending at the time of discharge
E after being hospitalized forfive days  the patient was completely stable in therapeutic rangeon coumadin without focal neurologic findings and without obvioussource of her transient ischemic attack beyond a mild transientarrhythmia
E therefore  she was discharged with instructions tofollowup with her regular th physician for continued monitoringof her coumadin dosing and pt levels as well as longterminstructions for followup care
C discharge medications 
C atenolol 50 mg qd andcoumadin 5 mg qhs
