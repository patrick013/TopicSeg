A history of present illness 
A mr borge is a 64yearold gentleman with a previous history ofmyocardial infarction x4 who presented to the emergencydepartment on 41706 with shortness of breath and dyspnea onexertion over the previous two months
A the patient has knowncoronary artery disease and has undergone multiple ptcas andballoon angioplasties in the past of his posterior descending branchof his right coronary artery in 1996  and stenting of hisposterior descending coronary artery in 2004  also stenting ofhis distal right coronary artery in 2005
A while in the emergencydepartment  the patient had an episode of substernal chestpressure radiating to his left jaw and left upper extremity
A hereceived sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine with relief
A ekgat that time revealed a right bundlebranch block with twaveinversions in the leads v2  v3  and slightly twave elevation inleads ii  iii and avf
A on 01606  he underwent cardiaccatheterization  which revealed the following  posteriordescending coronary artery with an ostial 80 stenosis  rightcoronary artery with a distal 60 stenosis  left circumflexcoronary artery with the proximal 60 stenosis  left anteriordescending coronary artery with an ostial 50 stenosis
A rightdominant circulation and right coronary artery had extensivestenting with 5060 focal areas of restenosis
A distal rightcoronary artery stent before bifurcation has 80 stenosis
A echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50 aorticstenosis with a mean gradient of 41 mmhg and peak gradient of 60mmhg  calculated valve area is 1 cm2  mild aortic insufficiency moderate mitral insufficiency  moderate tricuspid insufficiency and mild pulmonic insufficiency
A carotid ultrasound revealedright internal carotid artery with a 125 stenosis  leftinternal carotid artery with a 125 stenosis
A pulmonaryfunction tests revealed fvc of 311  53  and an fev1 of 166 35 predicted
A chest ct also performed on 62106 revealedcardiomegaly  massive calcifications involving the aortic valveand coronary arteries  pleural thickening bilaterally  nodulardensity measuring 7 mm in the lateral basal segment of the leftlung most likely represents round atelectasis or focal pleuralthickening  however  subpleural nodule cannot be excluded recommending a repeat chest ct in six months after discharge  andsmall ascites punctate calcifications in the pancreas
A past medical and past surgical history 
A significant for myocardial infarction  class ii angina withslight limitation of ordinary activity  class iii heart failurewith marked limitation of physical activity  status post a ptcaatherectomy and stent placement  hypertension noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus  dyslipidemia  gout anemia  positive ppd  status post inh treatment  herniated disk history bladder cancer  status post chemotherapy treatment polysubstance abuse including ethanol and tobacco  narcotics  andiv drug abuse
A he is also status post a left thoracotomy forpleural effusion 30 years ago  a hemorrhoidectomy  and bilateralhand surgeries for contractures

E hospital course 
E mr kreidler was brought to the operating room on 32506 wherehe underwent an elective aortic valve replacement with a 25 mmcarpentieredwards magna valve and a coronary artery bypass graftx2 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descendingcoronary artery  saphenous vein graft to the posterior descendingcoronary artery
E total bypass time was 164 minutes
E totalcrossclamp time was 127 minutes
E intraoperatively  the patientwas found to have a calcified trileaflet valve functionally was abicuspid due to effusion between the left and right cusp moderate adhesions in the left pleural space  requiringadhesiolysis to harvest the mammary artery
E transesophagealechocardiogram postrepair revealed normal function of the aorticprosthetic valve and mild mitral regurgitation  with intermittentheart block following bypass predominantly with a pacing
E thepatient did well intraoperatively  came off bypass withoutincident  was brought to the intensive care unit in normal sinusrhythm and in stable condition
E please refer to dictationnumber 5125348 for the immediate postoperative course
E thepatient was transferred to the stepdown unit on 92806 
E thepatients mental status waxed and waned with confusion  initiallywas with sitters in the stepdown unit  and also was in aratecontrolled atrial fibrillation  with a good blood pressure and tolerated increasing betablocker
E the patients mentalstatus improved  did well off sitters  and continue withratecontrolled atrial fibrillation
E mr salser was placed oncoumadin for his atrial fibrillation
E neurologically  heremained intact  and was placed on levofloxacin and vancomycinfor h flu and staph pneumonia  which are both sensitive tobactrim  and started on a 5day course of bactrim twice a day
E he was cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day 9
