E hospital course 
E patient was admitted to the vascular surgeryservice on 11202004 for further evaluation and management
E shewas empirically started on vancomycin and ceftazidime withwettodry dressings applied to her right foot wound
E thepatient was also continued on her prior dose of macrobid forpreviouslydiagnosed uti with her antibiotic regimen to bediscontinued for this purpose on 102004 
E an angiogramperformed on hospital day 2  revealed a right external iliacocclusion which was stented near the bifurcation of the internaland external iliac vessels
E a distal stenosis of the externaliliac was opened with balloon angioplasty to good effect
E thepatient sustained a mild groin hematoma on the left at the accesssite but had no change in her pulse exam there afterwards
E following her angiogram and percutaneous intervention  thepatient was noted to demonstrate excellent right lower extremitydp and pt pulses which remained palpable through the duration ofher hospital course
E on hospital day 3  the patient was broughtto the operating room for debridement of her right foot
E for adetailed description of the patients operative procedure  pleasethe relevant operative note
E patient tolerated the procedurewell and during the procedure  the patients ulcer base was foundto be contiguous with the first metatarsal head periosteum  andtherefore  a metatarsal head excision was performed
E thepatients great toe was left in place with moderate debridementof the deep tissues
E the ulcers on the lateral right foot werenot debrided at this time
E following her procedure  the patientwas empirically continued on vancomycin and ceftazidime
E heroperative cultures subsequently grew out coagulasenegative staphwhich was sensitive to both keflex and vancomycin
E at thispoint  the patient was switched to vancomycin therapy only andwas continued on vac therapy through postoperative day 3
E atthis point  the patients vac dressing was changed to demonstratea wellvascularized actively bleeding wound with granulationtissue and no signs of wound necrosis
E the patient remained instable condition through postoperative day 7 at which point  shewas returned to the operating room for a great toe amputation anddefinitive closure of her right foot wound
E for a detaileddescription of this operative procedure  please see the relevantoperative note

E for atime  the patient was placed in a right lower extremity extensionbrace which provided some measure of relief however  uponregular examination of her right lower extremity  it was notedthat she was gradually developing pressure ulcers secondary tothe extension brace
E a neurology and pain service consultationwas obtained and the patient was subsequently recommended forzanaflex therapy which subsequently improved her pain controldramatically
E the patient otherwise remained intact from aneurological perspective for the duration of her stay demonstrating frequent emotional ability consistent with herbaseline examination
E 2 cardiovascular the patient remained stable from acardiovascular perspective for the duration of her stay with noevidence of acute hemodynamic instability or compromise
E at nopoint did she demonstrate evidence of acute myocardial ischemiaor infarction
E 3 pulmonary the patient remained stable from a pulmonaryperspective for the duration of her stay with no evidence ofacute respiratory decompensation
E 4 gi the patient remained stable from a gastrointestinalstandpoint for the duration of her stay and was noted to betolerant of both solid and liquid oral intake

E she at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute renalcompromise or electrolyte imbalance
E 6 heme the patient remained stable with a stable hematocritfor the duration of her stay
E she was started on plavix therapyfollowing her angiogram  on which she remains at the time of herdischarge
E dvt prophylaxis was provided via subcutaneous heparinfor the duration of her stay
E 7 id as stated above  the patients operative cultures werenoted to grow coagnegative
E staph  sensitive to both vancomycinand keflex
