E hospital course 
E in summary  in terms of the hematemesis from the gi standpoint there was no blood shown in the emesis during thehospitalization
E her symptoms were treated with reglan initially iv than po
E the differential diagnosis on admissionwas gastroenteritis due to sick contacts  gastritis secondary topervious history of nsaid use  ulcer  recurrent esophagealstricture  other enteritis or dka given elevated glucose levelsand anion gap on admission
E other things considered wereatypical cardiac ischemia
E in order to evaluate the cause of thehematemesis  she underwent the barium swallow on 1405 
E unfortunately  this test was canceled prematurely due to evidenceof aspiration on the initial swallow
E she was kept npo
E from7605 to 07 until video swallow could be performed which showed minimal aspiration with swallowing  but wasimproved with chin tuck maneuver
E an initial diet of mechanicalsoft with liquids was recommended with advancement as necessary
E gi was consulted  dr costine attending  and upper endoscopywas performed on 42105  which showed nonerosive esophagitisand a hiatal hernia  both known by history  otherwise  there wasno ulcerations and no stricture
E the emesis subsided during thehospitalization

E from a cardiovascular standpoint  her hospital staywas complicated by two distinct episodes of supraventriculartachycardia with rapid ventricular response  one on 101105 andone on 92905 
E the event on 101105 occurred at 500 pmwith heart rates in 200 range
E she was treated with lopressor 5mg followed by diltiazem 20 mg x2  which then caused reduction inthe heart rate to the 90s
E diltiazem 60 mg po qid was thenadded to her regimen
E on 92905  at 200 am  she had heartrate to the 160s  again was treated with diltiazem 20 mg iv x1and her heart rate decreased to the 90s

E from an infectiousdisease standpoint  there were no obvious infections diagnosedduring this stay  but the results of stool cultures are pending
E her pulmonary status remained stable with good o2 saturation onroom air throughout the hospitalization
E from an endocrinestandpoint  her diabetes was moderately controlled during herhospitalization
E she was switched from her standing nph toregular insulin sliding scale while npo because of low bloodsugars
E after initiating po intake  her sugars were initiallyuncontrolled and aggressively managed with regular insulinsliding scale in addition to an nph standing regimen
E upondischarge  ms azen was afebrile with heart rate of 72  range6893  normotensive with the blood pressure of 12050 with goodo2 saturation on room air of 93
