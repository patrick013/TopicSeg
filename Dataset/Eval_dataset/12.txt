D the patient was alert and oriented timesthree and able to understand questions  but she had decreasedverbal skills
B laboratory data 
B sma20 and cbc were within normal range
B herldh was slightly elevated at 419  alkalinephosphatase elevated at 746
B total protein was decreased at 64 albumin decreased at 36
B her digoxin level was 04
B she was onheparin with a ptt of 588
B ekg showed a sinus rhythm of 89  poorr wave progression  old ischemic myocardial infarction  t waveinversions in 1  l  and v5v6
B chest xray  by report from noxer kingsnew tesbucks health of  showed mild cardiomegaly  pulmonary venoushypertension  elevated right hemidiaphragm
E hospital course 
E on transfer  the patient was evaluated with anechocardiogram which showed global hypokinesiswith an ejection fraction of 20 and severely dilated heart
E cardiac catheterization was contemplated to rule out ischemia asher source of cardiomyopathy  but given that catheterization wouldlikely require intubation secondary to sedation given her psychissues  the decision was made to pursue a more conservative coursewith treatment of medication
E she was aggressively treated forcongestive heart failure with digoxin  ace inhibitor  and iv lasixand she continued to get iv lasix bid
E 40 mg
E she remainedstable while in the hospital and  after several days of diuresis her edema slowly improved
E her breathing improved and she began toambulate
E she lost approximately 8 kg while in hospital
E her second issue was gastrointestinal
E she continued to have  onadmission  an elevated ldh and alkaline phosphatase in the absenceof significant transaminases  it was not consistent with passivecongestion alone
E we continued to follow them and they eventuallydrifted down
E the source of her elevations were never clear
E wechecked the ammonia level which was normal and a sedimentation ratewhich was normal
E her third issue was infectious disease
E her urine  by report atymont taplaeast hospital  had greater than 1015 ecoli
E she was nottreated with antibiotics
E we repeated the urinalysis here andbegan ampicillin on po for a urinary tract infection  which shecontinued for a full 10 day course
E they felt that her urinarytract infection was secondary to limited ambulation and her bodyhabitus
E the fourth issue was fluids  electrolytes  and nutrition
E she hadtotal body edema and anasarca with slightly decreased protein andalbumin  but most likely secondary to severe congestive heartfailure
E her mucous membranes were dry  but felt this wassecondary to her breathing and possible intervascular depletion
E all of these issues cleared as she was diuresed
E the fifth issue was psych
E we continued her medications andcontacted her family for support while she was in the hospital
E the patient did well and once she was able to walk around withphysical therapy  she was discharged on lasix  digoxin  and withvna
