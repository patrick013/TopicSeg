approximately 47 liters her weight went down 6 kg transfer floor cardiology heart failure service she still appeared somewhat volume overloaded despite 100 mg iv lasix q day terms her rate she normal transfer from ccu she had normal sinus rhythm occasional signs paroxysmal atrial fibrillation thought possibly due her pulmonary process terms her ischemia she had some troponin leak it thought be setting chf but trending downward her blood pressure difficult control likely due medical noncompliance longstanding hypertension home she captopril hydralazine amlodipine 2 terms o her pulmonary status question left infiltrate her chest xray so she started levofloxacin she continued be treated solumedrol iv switching prednisone 60 mg po her abg showed mild retention be expected setting we continued levalbuterol nebulizers q4h as as atrovent nebulizers q4h did start steroid taper she transferred from ccu floor ace march 2005 after fiveday stay ccu briefly summarized her floor course by following problems 1 cardiovascular terms her pump she continued be diuresed down thought be goal dry weight between 82 84 kg we able accomplish diuresis lasix 120 mg bid po did need initiate form drips we attempted diurese her down euvolemic weight approximately 84 kg discharge rhythm 30 april march she developed atrial fibrillation rapid ventricular rate into 130s placed diltiazem iv drip titrated up heart rate below 100 maximal rate reached 140 150 we switched diltiazem drip over diltiazem po tid up dose eventually 150 mg bid then sequentially brought down later during admission we also started digoxin po started heparin anticoagulation it time decided electrical cardioversion be optimal her stay so it decided she be chemically cardioverted using drug dofetilide otherwise tikosyn we initiated doses dofetilide february 2005 first loading dose 250 mcg then 500 mcg bid she watched carefully ekgs before every dose dofetilide because risk torsade de pointes we kept her magnesium repleted she tolerated chemical cardioversion went back into mostly sinus rhythm too much ectopy or signs other arrhythmia then we able decrease her diltiazem down 60 mg po tid ischemia she

revealed strong palpable pulse systolic blood pressure 130 heart rate 80 over course next few minutes patient became increasingly more responsive she treated fluid bolus patient quickly responded fluid bolus became interactive she reported she sitting commode urinating began feel nauseous presyncopal she able get bed point she passed she denied chest pain or pressure shortness breath during event rhythm check obtained during time event demonstrated pause six seconds followed by junctional escape rhythm an electrocardiogram obtained after code demonstrated acute changes her acute bradycardic event felt likely secondary her new beta blocker conjunction vagal response it determined stop beta blocker atropine placed bedside following day patient underwent an echocardiogram demonstrated dilated right ventricle secondary chronic dysfunction pulmonary artery pressure greater than 100 her stress test cancelled ct angiogram ordered evaluate chronic thromboembolic disease as potential cause her pulmonary hypertension she ruled myocardial infarction three sets normal enzymes continued be monitored telemetry pulmonary consultation obtained evaluate possible etiology patient hypotension little evidence suggest cardiac disease given patient graves disease an autoimmune process felt be possible addition consideration given sarcoidosis human immunodeficiency virus druginduced given her history herbal medication use it recommended patient begin anticoagulation given severity her pulmonary hypertension it also planned undergo right heart catheterization vasodilation trial by catheterization laboratory right heart catheterization performed 20141205 pharmacologic pulmonary vasodilator challenge performed positive response addition ct angiogram chest pulmonary embolism protocol showed intravascular filling defect but did show right upper lobe groundglass scattered adenopathy therefore end left atrial hypertension essentially ruled as primary cause chronic pulmonary embolus less likely given her negative ct angiogram chronic lung disease unlikely given patient normal pulmonary function tests dlco 2012 as as normal ct angiogram collagen vascular disease be definitively ruled however given patient lack connective tissue disorder stigmata it thought be less likely patient human immunodeficiency virus test negative therefore it felt patient most likely experiencing primary pulmonary hypertension consideration given treating patient course calcium channel blocker however given patient poor response lopressor it determined be optimal treatment patient pulmonary hypertension therefore her insurance company contacted regarding potential flolan as treatment plans made placement hickman catheter initiation flolan treatment however 1207 patient once again experienced an episode unresponsiveness upon arrival by physician patient awake alert oriented pulse 80 pressure 80 satting 100 room air she described episode as an uncomfortable feeling her chest patient treated 2 liters intravenous fluids bump her systolic blood pressure 90 review telemetry revealed an 8 9 beat episode nonsustained ventricular tachycardia followed by an episode bradycardia 60 beats per minute etiology these cardiovascular episodes unclear but felt likely secondary patient tenuous cardiovascular status given fact she had clear pulmonary hypertension very preload dependent had an intact left ventricular function but cardiac output limited due left ventricular compression by dilated left ventricle given patient persistent hypotensive episodes decreased urine output she transferred back medical intensive care unit management prior initiation flolan therapy 1208 hickman catheter placed preparation flolan administration during mass mental health center medical intensive care unit stay patient found exquisitely preload dependent responded aggressive fluids as needed maintain her blood pressure systolic greater than 90 she had further episodes bradycardia during her medical intensive care unit stay addition patient urine output improved dramatically hydration therapy suggesting her low urine output secondary decreased cardiac output secondary low preload patient continued be followed by electrophysiology service who determined patient demonstrating severe vasal sensitivity bradycardia necessitating pacemaker placement be deferred until after patient had her hickman place because patient pulmonary pressures responded so adenosine during right heart catheterization it thought patient be good candidate flolan therapy flolan initiated 1208 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute patient monitored symptoms flolan therapy including nausea vomiting first bite jaw claudication or hypotension over course hospital stay patient flolan dose titrated receive maximum benefit precipitating symptoms flolan overdose patient felt be stable her current flolan dose therefore transferred back floor high resolution ct requested further evaluate possible secondary cause her primary pulmonary hypertension however patient refused it time plans placement pacemaker initiated however night prior planned surgical date patient suffered an episode bleeding from her hickman catheter site surgery notified pressure applied however it did stop oozing surgicel dressing placed prolonged pressure resulted resolution bleeding addition an extra stitch placed an effort stop bleeding following episode patient felt like she too stressed pacemaker placement therefore she monitored over next few days further bleeding events over course next few days patient became more accustomed her flolan flolan teaching continued she continued occasional episodes dizziness shortness breath hypotension whenever alarm sounded suggesting flolan bag needed be changed however over course hospital stay these decreased both frequency severity 1215 patient went placement pacemaker she had dualmode dualpacing dualsensing pacemaker placed lower rate 60 ppm upper

secondary low preload patient continued be followed by electrophysiology service who determined patient demonstrating severe vasal sensitivity bradycardia necessitating pacemaker placement be deferred until after patient had her hickman place because patient pulmonary pressures responded so adenosine during right heart catheterization it thought patient be good candidate flolan therapy flolan
